The Comprehensive Bitcoin Market Intelligence dataset integrates price data with multi-source external signals for holistic market analysis. Beyond traditional OHLCV data, it incorporates real-time social sentiment from Twitter and Reddit, macroeconomic indicators (Fed rates, Treasury yields, stock indices), and Bitcoin network fundamentals (hash rate, active addresses, exchange flows). This 100+ feature dataset enables regime-aware predictions by capturing the complex interplay between price action, market psychology, economic conditions, and blockchain network health.

External Data Sources: Social sentiment analysis captures market psychology through Twitter sentiment scores, Reddit engagement, and Fear & Greed Index. Macroeconomic integration includes Federal Reserve interest rates, Treasury yield curves, S&P 500 performance, VIX volatility index, and Dollar Index (DXY) for broader financial market context. Bitcoin network fundamentals encompass hash rate momentum, active address counts, exchange inflow/outflow patterns, MVRV ratios, and long-term holder behavior.

Multi-Dimensional Analysis: This dataset enables prediction models to understand Bitcoin's position within the broader financial ecosystem. Correlations with traditional assets, sensitivity to monetary policy, and network adoption metrics provide comprehensive context for price forecasting that extends beyond technical chart patterns.

Prediction Approach: Leverage the multi-source intelligence to generate forecasts that account for market psychology, macroeconomic trends, and network fundamentals. Focus on identifying confluence between technical signals and external factors to improve prediction accuracy and risk assessment.
